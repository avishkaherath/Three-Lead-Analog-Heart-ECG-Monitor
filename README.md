# Three-Lead Analog Heart ECG Monitor
A heart ECG monitor records the heart's electrical activity in real-time, aiding in diagnosing conditions like arrhythmias. Electrodes on the left shoulder, right shoulder, and lower left abdomen capture a 3-lead ECG signal. Noise reduction via an instrumentation amplifier improves signal quality, while a notch filter combats 50Hz power supply interference. Filtered through low-pass (150Hz) and high-pass (0.05Hz) filters, the relevant cardiac signal is refined. This filtered ECG signal is then amplified and displayed on an oscilloscope, providing a clear view of the heart's electrical behavior for accurate diagnosis.
