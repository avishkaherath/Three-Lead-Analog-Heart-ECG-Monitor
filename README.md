# Three-Lead Analog Heart ECG Monitor
A heart ECG monitor is a device that provides real-time electrical measurements of the heart's activity, aiding in diagnosing cardiac conditions like arrhythmias. This non-invasive method utilizes a 3-lead ECG signal acquired through electrodes placed on the left shoulder, right shoulder, and lower left abdomen. To enhance signal quality, noise reduction is performed using an instrumentation amplifier. Additionally, interference from 50Hz power supply noise is mitigated using a notch filter.

After noise reduction, the signal undergoes further refinement through a low-pass filter (cut-off frequency: 150Hz) and a high-pass filter (cut-off frequency: 0.05Hz). These filters isolate the essential cardiac signal while eliminating unwanted frequencies. The resulting filtered ECG signal is then amplified and displayed on an oscilloscope, enabling healthcare professionals to observe the heart's electrical activity.
