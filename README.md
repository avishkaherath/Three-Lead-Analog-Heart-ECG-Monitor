# Three-Lead Analog Heart ECG Monitor
 A heart ECG monitor is a device capable of displaying an electrical measurement of the human heart in real-time. It is a non-invasive method of diagnosing many diseases related to the body's cardiac system, such as arrhythmias. The device takes as input a 3-lead ECG signal using electrodes placed on the left shoulder, right shoulder, and the bottom side of the left abdomen. Then, the effect of the noise of the input signal is minimized by noise filtering using an instrumentation amplifier. The effect of the 50Hz noise from the power supply is further reduced by the addition of a notch filter. The signal obtained after noise filtering is sent through a low-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 150Hz and a high-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of 0.05Hz in order to obtain the relevant signal. The final amplified ECG signal is displayed on the oscilloscope.
